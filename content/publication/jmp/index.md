abstract: "Battery electric vehicles (BEVs) are widely viewed as an effective option for vehicle
owners to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, but the amount of emissions reduction that is
achieved depends on the mix of energy sources used to produce the electricity for charging
the BEV. Since the emissions in question are indirect, it is currently unclear whether differences
in energy production mix affect vehicle purchasing behavior. This paper investigates
how the emissions associated with charging a BEV influence choices between three different
fuel types and how much individuals are willing to pay to offset their carbon dioxide
emissions through vehicle choice. I use a mixed multinomial logit model that is estimated
with data from a discrete choice experiment with 1,658 individuals in five US metropolitan
areas who intended to purchase a new car within the next 5 years of the survey date.
The results indicate that individualsâ€™ vehicle choices are significantly impacted by the
indirect emissions from charging a BEV and by the regional mix of energy sources used for
power generation. The results across multiple emissions scenarios indicate that individuals
are willing to pay approximately 225 dollars per year for each metric ton of carbon dioxide
emissions the electric vehicle offsets compared to a conventional vehicle. Thus, when
purchasing a BEV, an individual is willing to pay about $7,000 more than for a conventional
vehicle due to the emissions reduction. This willingness to pay is highly heterogeneous
across individuals."
